During the python environment setup I experienced issues with an absence of the "llvmlite" for successful
"librosa" installation (basically the heart of the project). So here is the link to the guide that 
worked out pretty well for me, and an additional step in the end.

I chose llvm 10.0.1 and librosa works fine with it, but before "pip install librosa" you should
make this variable in shell environment.

$ echo 'export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/local/clang_10.0.1/bin/llvm-config' >> ~/.bashrc

And that's all, you are free to start librosa installation.
