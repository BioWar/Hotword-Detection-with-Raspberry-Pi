To control microphone option and audio output you should use:

$ alsamixer

"librosa" requires audio ONLY in floating point variant, and "pyaudio" supports it. However, I was
unable to record audio in format=pyaudio.paFloat32 (audio was more similar to white noise rather than speech), only in Int formats.
To fix this issue I followed the next guide:

After that, I kinda was solved. If after the audio configuration main.py could not predict
the trigger word you should probably tweak parameters on your laptop/PC.
